Hello :hand_over_mouth:, welcome to my humble project, it consists of a system for the administration of libraries, which can surely serve as a base to scale it to your needs.
It is still in development so I will be doing the updates so that I have the time. It should be noted that from the design to the server it has been developed by me, if you have any suggestions or contributions, I will be very grateful.

### What I used for this?

- Angular
- Pure CSS
- SASS
- JSON Web Token
- Node Js
- MySQL

I'm still working to complete the project, the idea is to build a base from which to start to develop.

Thank u for look this! :kissing_heart:
